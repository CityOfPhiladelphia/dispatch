## Customizable look-and-feel

Dispatch can be configured to match the colors of your existing website. It can even be extended to use an in-house style guide like the [US Web Design Standards](https://pages.18f.gov/designstandards/).

## Open source

Dispatch is free and open-source software, meaning that you'll never pay a cent in license costs. The fact that Dispatch is open-source also means that you don't have to take our word with regard to its quality: you can see for yourself that Dispatch's code is clean, well-tested, and secure.
